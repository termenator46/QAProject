## API Test Collection

This repository includes a sample Postman collection for API testing:
- `Task_Tracker_API.postman_collection.json`

You can import this file into Postman to see and run example API tests (positive and negative scenarios for user management, projects, and authorization).

*For interviewers:*  
Feel free to explore the collection. This is a demonstration of my practical skills in API testing, using real test scripts and request example
